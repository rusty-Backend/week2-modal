# week2-modal
web-and-hybrid-technologies-in-mobile-programming Week 2

The documentation example for this homework was almost a direct copy-paste solution, so I tried to work around it and improve the user experience (UX).

Instead of using onPress to open the modal, I replaced it with onLongPress, which requires the user to hold the button for 1 second.

Added a background dimming effect when the modal is opened.

The dimming looked unnatural with the slide animation, so I changed it to fade.

Modified the hardware back button behavior to ask the user for confirmation before closing the modal.
