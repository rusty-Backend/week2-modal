# week2-modal
web-and-hybrid-technologies-in-mobile-programming Week 2

The documentation related to the homework had almost straight on copy-paste code so I tried to play a round it and add some better UX. 

Instead of using onPress to open the modal, I replaced it with onLongPress which requires the user to hold button 1 second.

Added background dimming effect when modal is opened.

The dimming looked unnatural when it had 'slide' animation -> changed to 'fade'

Modified the hardware back button to ask if user wants to continue.
